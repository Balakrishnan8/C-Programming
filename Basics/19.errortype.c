		compile time is the time at which the source code is converted into executable code.
		
	run time:
		runtime is the time at which the executable code is running.
		
	compile time error occurs when we write the wrong syntax. compile time error can be syntax error or semantic error. eg: put colon, instead of semicolon to terminate the line or wrong assignment (a+b = c).
	
	runtime error occurs during the execution of the program. Compiler does not detect the these type of error. eg: division by zero, square root of negative number.
