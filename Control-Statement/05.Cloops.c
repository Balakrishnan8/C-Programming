		-> Looping can be defined as the same process multiple times until the specific condition met.
		-> Loops provide code reusability. Instead of using same code again and again, we can use loops.
		-> Loops used for traversing an array.
		-> Types of Loops:
		
		1) do while
				
			-> do-while loops continues until a given conditions met.
			-> it is post tested loop.(condition will be checked after one execution)
			-> mostly used for menu driven programs.
			
			syntax:
				do
				{
					// block of codes;
				}while(condition);
				
			
		2) while
			
			-> while loop is used when number of iteration is unknown. while loop executes until the specified condition met.
			-> it is pre-tested loop.(condition will be first, if only the condition is true, then loop will be executed.)
			-> mostly used when the number of iteration is unknown in advance.
			
			syntax:
				while(expression)
				{
					// block of codes;
				}
			
			
		3) for
		
			-> for loop is used when some lines of codes are executed repeatedly until the specified condition is met.
			-> it is pre-tested loop.
			-> mostly used when number of iteration is known in advance.
			
			
			syntax:
				for(initialization;condition;incre/decre)
				{
					// block of codes;
				}
